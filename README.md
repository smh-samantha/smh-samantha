## Welcome to My Fullstack Journey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year mechanical engineering and compsci student at **UNSW** and a junior developer at **NUKON** where I've had the opportunity to work on SCADA systems and get involved in real-world software development projects. 
Whenever else I can, I'm a Freelance Developer.
